### **Jira Instances Explained (With Examples)**  

A **Jira Instance** refers to a unique installation or cloud-based setup of Jira used by a company, team, or project. It includes all projects, users, and data within that specific Jira environment.

### **Types of Jira Instances**
1. **Jira Cloud Instance** – Hosted by Atlassian on the cloud. No manual server setup is needed.  
   - *Example: A startup uses `company.atlassian.net` to manage their projects on Jira Cloud.*  
2. **Jira Server Instance** – Installed on a company’s own servers. Offers more control and customization.  
   - *Example: A bank installs Jira on its internal servers for security reasons.*  
3. **Jira Data Center Instance** – A scalable, enterprise-level setup for large organizations with high availability.  
   - *Example: A multinational company with 10,000+ users uses Jira Data Center for better performance.*
